    1. type the command "make" to compile, link, and run the program with no command line arguments
    2. once compiled and linked, you can also use the command "./cat" with filenames or "-" (for input) passed as command line arguments
    3. clean the directory by using the command "make clean" to remove any object files each time before recompiling.
